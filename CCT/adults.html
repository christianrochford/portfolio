            <h2>Adult Programme</h2>
            <h3>You've had the lessons, what do you do now...</h3>
            <p>OK, you saw all the celebs on 'Faoi Lán Cheoil' on the telly. You thought if they could do it, well you could do it too. So you got yourself the fiddle or the flute or whatever and you got the lessons. You have the first ten or twelve tunes under you belt. Now what!</p>
            <p>You want to join in but the sessions are too fast and they're not playing your tunes anyway or maybe they did but it was just about over before you recognised it.</p>
            <p>We know the frustrations of the adult learner because we have been there too. So we devised a programme to provide a bridge from learning your instrument to session playing.</p>
            <h3>Who is it suitable for?</h3>
            <p>Because the programme does not focus on the technicalities of playing a particular instrument it is not suitable for absolute beginners. Our classes on Saturday morning are more appropriate for beginners. If you have a year or two under your belt and are looking to further develop your musical skills, build up your repertoire and play with others then this is the ideal place for you!</p>
            <h3>Level 1 - Entry level</h3>
            <p>If you have a year or two's classes behind you then Level 1 is probably the most suitable. The focus is on building basic repertoire, ear training and learning to play with others in a group. The class is taken at a very gentle and slow pace. It is led by the great accordion player Seamus Meehan.</p>
            <p>The Level 1 class takes place weekly from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM Teusday evenings in the Artane Beaumont Family Recreation Centre (opposite Tesco @ Artaine Castle).</p>
            <h3>Level 2 - Intermediate level</h3>
            <p>If you have three to four year's playing behind you then you are probably ready for Level 2. Again the focus is on building repertoire, ear training and learning to play with others in a group. The pace of the class is a more sprightly than Level 1 and while the focus is on teaching tunes commonly played in sessions they will be more difficult than those taught in Level 1.</p>
            <p>The Level 2 class takes place weekly from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM Teusday evenings in the Artane Beaumont Family Recreation Centre (opposite Tesco @ Artaine Castle).</p>
            <h3>Slow session</h3>
            <p>From 9 PM to 10:00 there is a slow guided session. The idea is to build on the skills developed in the Level 2 class in that it focuses on tunes learnt there. The session is led by an experienced musician who provides expert coaching to the group. The focus is on building up skills required for playing in a group situation - rhythmic precision and learning to play with others.</p>
            <p>This will be most suitable for those at an intermediate level, i.e. those with at least three years playing experience who want to further develop their musical ability. It is particularly recommende dfor those attending the level 2 classes.</p>
            <h3>Repertoire</h3>
            <p>The repertoire being taught can be found <a href="3">here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Where? When? How much?</h3>
            <p>Classes take place Tuesday evenings in the Artane Beaumont Family Recreation Centre (opposite Tesco @ Artane Castle). See map below.</p>
            <!--insert map-->
            <p>The Spring 2013 programme starts Tuesday January 15th 2013.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Level 1 Beginners 7:00 - 8:00 PM</li>
                <li>Level 2 Intermediate 8:00 - 9:00 PM</li>
                <li>Slow Session 9:00 - 10:00 PM</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The cost is €7.50 per hour (i.e. per class or session). Or €5 per hour if you do more than one. So for example if you did Level 2 class only the fee would be €7.50 but if you did the slow session as well it would be €10. All fees are payable per term in advance.</p>

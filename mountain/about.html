        <h3>Mountain Service Station all started when three brothers identified the need for a service station which looks after its environment and supports its community. We’re a family run business which depends on the community and, as such, support our community as much as we can in return.</h3>

            <h2>Strategy & Vision</h2>
            <p>We’ve got a passion for the environment and have built our business on this with an aim to share our passion with the community. Our service station is a sustainable project which has been certified by <a href="http://www.breeam.org" target="new">BREEAM</a>, the world leader in the evaluation and certification of sustainable buildings. We see our business as more than a place to fuel your car and as such aim to provide you with a homely environment where you can relax without having to drive in. We’re big fans of <a href="cyclists.html">cycling</a> and strive to provide a place where cyclists are as at home with us as our drive-in customers. We also hope you’ll be happy to simply walk-in to enjoy a great service in our <a href="food.html">café and diner</a>.</p>

            <h2>Local Presence</h2>
            <p>With a strong connection to our local <a href="community.html">community</a> we have worked hard on building a local presence among our neighbours and feel our business has benefited greatly from our community projects. We work hard to promote integration amongst people with different abilities both at the workplace and outside and ensure our <a href="careers.html">staff</a> work in an environment that allows them to enjoy their work. Since the beginning we have been promoting a committed and supportive model of social coexistence, improving people's quality of life and helping to bring about the social integration of groups that are most disadvantaged or most at risk of exclusion.</p> 
            <p>We share a love of good <a href="food.html">food</a>, to supply a wealth of local and artisan produce to the residents of the surrounding area. All of our food is prepared with organic and free-range produce from <a href="community.html">local farmers</a>. Come by on a Saturday morning as the car park buzzes with the activity of stalls setting up and the first customers arriving for our weekly <a href="community.html">farmer’s market</a>.</p>
